# Changelog

## dev

## v1.0 (June 15, 2020)

* Enhancement: RetDec JSON output's ASM to C mapping is used to make the plugin address-aware ([#49](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/49)).
* Enhancement: RetDec's JSON output is used for syntax highlighting ([#48](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/48)).
* Enhancement: The plugin is not a stand-alone package - i.e. a separate RetDec installation is not required ([#8](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/8)). There are no longer any external process launches ([#37](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/37), [#40](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/40), [#56](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/56), [#58](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/58), [#59](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/59), [#60](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/60)).
* Fix: Show the decompilation windows always next to a disassembly IDA view window ([#12](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/12)).
* Fix: Fixed the build of the plugin under IDA 7.4 ([#54](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/pull/54)).

## v0.9 (March 19, 2019)

* Allow x86-64 decompilation.

## v0.8 (January 21, 2018)

* Added a 64-bit address space version of RetDec IDA plugin ([#21](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/21)).
* Added support for decompilation of Mach-O binary files ([#11](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/11)).

## v0.7 (September 5, 2018)

* Fix: Fix Python interpreter execution via `py -3` command ([#33](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/pull/33)).
* Fix: Add Python interpreter checks and make it possible to configure path to the Python interpreter to use ([#29](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/29#issuecomment-417363723)).

## v0.6 (August 16, 2018)

* Updated plugin in order to work with the new Python implementation of RetDec scripts.
* Added support for macOS ([#27](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/pull/27)).
* Fix: Upgrade to a new JsonCpp API ([#28](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/pull/28)).
* Fix: Terminate spawned decompilation process when IDA is closed or a new decompilation is triggered ([#20](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/20)).
* Fix: Decode and decompile only the selected function ([#6](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/6)).

## v0.5 (June 7, 2018)

* Added support for IDA 7.x ([#2](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/2)). Dropped support for IDA 6.x.
* Removed remote decompilation through RetDec's API ([#9](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/9), [#13](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/13)).
* Fix: `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is now used instead of `#!/bin/bash` to run the scripts ([avast/retdec #258](https://github.com/avast/retdec/issues/258)).
* Fix: Allow decompilation of input files with `f_LOADER` file type ([#3](https://github.com/avast/retdec-idaplugin/issues/3)).

## v0.4 (December 14, 2017)

* Added support for local decompilations. Requires locally installed [RetDec](https://github.com/avast/retdec).

## v0.3.1 (September 7, 2016)

* Fixed searching for the input file in cases when the `.idb` file was moved.
* The plugin now creates its temporary files in the directory with the `.idb` file, not in the directory with the input file.

## v0.3 (August 22, 2016)

* Added support for decompilation of COFF object files.
* Added support for decompilation of Intel HEX files.
* Added support for decompilation of files containing just raw machine code.
* Added generation of IDA comments into C files generated by full decompilation.
* The plugin no longer performs automatic decompilation of the opened file upon the start of IDA.
* The plugin no longer ignores statically linked functions when selective decompilation is invoked through IDA.
* The plugin does not allow decompilation of non-existing files like objects extracted from archives.
* The plugin does not allow decompilations that it cannot properly handle.

## v0.2 (January 26, 2016)

* Added an automatic check whether a newer version of the plugin is available. When a newer version exists, the user is prompted to download and install the latest version.
* The output from full decompilations is no longer syntax-highlighted with IDA's color tags.
* Several bug fixes.

## v0.1.1 (November 25, 2015)

* The plugin requires fewer third-party libraries.
